# BlackJack_Game
This is basically a game in which we take 2 input from the user in the form of pop up by clicking on Start Game.
We even have the option to continue the game by clicking on New Card and picking the one card.
If we loose then play again by clicking on New Start that will lead to fresh start of the game along with the price=0;
Then we compute their sum, if the sum of the  cards =21 then won and price will be added of 200 each time you win and if you want to continue then click on Next turn and continue with the same profit amount uptil now the person can click or choose new card when sum is less than eqaul to 20
